# AssettoCorsaTyreTemp
A plugin for Assetto Corsa that displays the tyre temperatures

This is a simple plugin for Assetto Corsa that allows you to view the temperatures of your tyres in real time.

## Installation
To install this plugin, put the TyreTemps folder in the python folder in your Assetto Corsa installation. For example this would be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python or something similar.

To enable the plugin within Assetto Corsa, run Assetto Corsa and go to the UI Module section of the General Settings. TyreTemps should appear in this list; click the corresponding checkbox.

The plugin is now able to be used in Assetto Corsa, enabled just like any other app by moving the mouse over to the right side of the screen during gameplay. The app will be located near the bottom, next to the gMeter and PythonChat apps.
